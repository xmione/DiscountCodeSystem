# A Story about Angles and Demons
## In the legendary War in Heaven, the weapons weren’t swords and shields in the earthly sense—they were manifestations of divine power, spiritual authority, and cosmic force. Think less medieval armory, more metaphysical warfare.
### ⚔️ Tools Used by Good Angels (Led by Michael)
#### - Words of Power: Divine utterances that could bless, curse, or banish. In biblical tradition, words themselves carry immense force—creation began with “Let there be light.”
#### - Flames of Fire: Symbolic of purification and judgment. Angels are described as “flaming ministers” (Hebrews 1:7), wielding fire as a cleansing and destructive force.
#### - Clouds of Glory: Used to shield, overwhelm, or disorient. These are often seen in Old Testament theophanies, representing God's majestic presence.
#### - Winds of God: Forces of nature under divine command. In Job 38, God speaks from a whirlwind—angels may have used similar elemental power.
### 🐉 Tools Used by Fallen Angels (Led by Lucifer)
#### - Deception and Persuasion: Lucifer’s greatest weapon was his ability to convince—to twist truth and seduce loyalty. His rebellion began with ideology, not violence.
#### - Miraculous Signs: Revelation 16 describes demonic spirits performing signs to rally forces for battle.
#### - Spiritual Force: Though corrupted, fallen angels retained immense power. Their tools were perversions of divine gifts—used to oppose, not uphold, the divine order.
### 🧩 Notable Interpretations
#### - In Paradise Lost, John Milton imagines angels wielding celestial armor, thunderbolts, and even mountains hurled like missiles—a poetic dramatization of spiritual conflict.
#### - Some traditions speak of a divine arsenal, guarded by angels like Virgil and stolen during heavenly civil wars.
#### This wasn’t a clash of steel—it was a war of will, essence, and allegiance. The battlefield was heaven itself, and the weapons were as vast and mysterious as the beings who wielded them.

## My Personal View
AI is just a tool. Good and evil can use it. I create AI as a tool for goodness.

In the bible, when Cain killed his brother Abel, it did not even mention the tool he used to kill his brother. The story emphasizes about the first crime committed in history out of pride and jealousy. The morale of the story is, it doesn't matter what tools you used. What matters is the intention and how you use it.

I compare AI as the Doctors of now and then. Before, there were no doctors. People just die of sickness. Human beings learned to search for ways to treat their body when sick. Then shamans and witch doctors arrived with their curses, incantations, spells and other tools like herbs, spices, liquor for pain. We learned to test and document our findings and statistics so that the knowledge can be transferred to the next generations. Then we called it the study of medicines and the ones who practice it, medical doctors. Average people did not trust them at first but because of commercialism, capitalism and statistics, we learned to bit by bit rely on their experience and knowledge about their craft and the tools they use. Until now, people with incurable diseases especially those who have terminal illness who only have years, months, weeks or even days to live still tries all sorts of healing process like traditional medicine, oriental medicine, etcetera. So they are all tools we use and are still available to us even at present times. Even priests use exorcism rites to drive out evil or possessions. 

AI no matter how we are excited by it or fear it or hesitant to use it and apply it in our daily lives, is inevitable that it will be a part of our life. It is not yet used by everyone for now in a daily basis but gradually like mobile phones it will be a necessity.

One fine example is all companies compete with each other and any company has a competitor or competitors. If your competitor uses a good tool to boost their income and net profit, if you don't want to be left behind (and nobody wants to be let behind), you should use a better tool to get ahead in the game and in the market.

For these reasons, I use AI to achieve a higher quality of my software applications and to complete them in record time. We can't memorize all code languages and design patterns and implementations but we know that they exist. That is why whenever I use AI, I try to document everything I did so whenever I don't have access to AI, I would be able to rebuild the application or create a new application from scratch by just reading the references I've created out of it.
