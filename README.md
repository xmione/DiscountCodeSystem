## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (5.0 or later)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install the [C# extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xmione/DiscountCodeSystem.git
cd DiscountCodeSystem
```

### Restoring Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

1. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+\`)

3. Navigate to the server directory and run:
   ```bash
   cd DiscountServer
   dotnet run
   ```

   The server will start listening on \`127.0.0.1:8888\`

### Testing with the Client

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+\`)

2. Navigate to the client directory and run:
   ```bash
   cd DiscountClient
   dotnet run
   ```

   The client will:
   - Prompt you to enter the count or number of concurrent requests, 10 is the default.
   - Generate test codes based on the supplied count (8 characters each)
   - Prompt you to enter a code to test
   - Test code usage (first use should succeed, second should fail)

### Testing with xUnit
- See the document [Testing the Discount Code System](Docs/Testing%20the%20Discount%20Code%20System.md) if you want to see how the test project was created and how to run it.
- See below commands if you want to go straight to testing it already using xUnit tests.

   #### From Command Line

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the test project directory
   cd DiscountCodeSystem.Tests

   # Run all tests
   dotnet test

   # Run specific project
   dotnet test DiscountCodeSystem.Tests

   # Run with verbose output
   dotnet test --verbosity normal

   # Run specific test method
   dotnet test --filter "TestName"
   ```

## API Protocol

The server uses a custom TCP protocol with binary messages:

### Generate Codes Request

| Position | Type    | Description          |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 0        | byte    | Message type (1)     |
| 1        | ushort  | Number of codes      |
| 3        | byte    | Code length (7-8)    |

### Generate Codes Response

| Position | Type    | Description          |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 0        | bool    | Success flag         |
| 1        | ushort  | Number of codes (if success) |
| 3+       | varies  | Codes (if success)   |

Each code is prefixed with its length (byte) followed by the code bytes.

### Use Code Request

| Position | Type    | Description          |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 0        | byte    | Message type (2)     |
| 1        | byte    | Code length          |
| 2        | bytes   | Code                 |

### Use Code Response

| Position | Type    | Description          |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 0        | byte    | Result code          |

Result codes:
- 0: Success
- 1: Code not found
- 2: Code already used

## Database

The system uses SQLite for persistent storage. The database file (\`discount_codes.db\`) is created automatically in the server directory when the server first runs.

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE DiscountCodes (
    Code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    IsUsed INTEGER NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Development

### Building the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd DiscountClient
dotnet run
```

### Debugging

1. Set breakpoints in VS Code by clicking in the gutter next to line numbers
2. Press F5 to start debugging
3. Use the debug console to inspect variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Make sure no other application is using port 8888
2. **Database locked**: This can happen if the server is terminated abruptly. Delete the \`discount_codes.db\` file to reset.
3. **Client connection errors**: Ensure the server is running before starting the client.

### Error Messages

- "BinaryWriter does not contain a definition for 'FlushAsync'": This was fixed in the latest version. Ensure you're using the corrected code.
- "Cannot connect to server": Verify the server is running and the address/port are correct.
